# Census_Data

This is what your program does:
1. Reads the data from the Excel spreadsheet
2. Counts the number of census tracts in each county
3. Counts the total population of each county
4. Prints the results

This means the code will need to do the following:
1. Open and read the cells of an Excel document with the openpyxl module.
2. Calculate all the tract and population data and store it in a data structure.
3. Write the data structure to a text file with the .py extension using the pprint module.
